**Data manipulation and querying with scala using spark**

I'm an university student studying data-science and this project was my way to learn to use apache spark with scala. 

**Project is split to 3 parts:**

1. Basic querying and data manipulation on football datasets
2. More advanced querying and data manipulation on football datasets
3. Machine learning task on time-series data

For my project I used datasets related to football found from here: https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000/5 and machine learning task from here: https://www.senecc.fi/projects/procem-2
I used Databricks as a platform for this project due to it's ability of working with apache spark and for the reason it being a popular platform for companies.

**Purpose**

The aim for this project was to introduce me to mechanics and capabilities of apache spark and the programming language scala. I also learned basic principals of data manipulation and machine learning with scala and spark.
