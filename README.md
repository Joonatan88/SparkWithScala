**Data manipulation and querying with scala using spark**

I'm an university student studying data-science and this project was my way to learn to use apache spark with scala. 

For my project I used datasets related to football found from here: https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000/5

The aim for this project was to introduce me to mechanics and capabilities of apache spark and the programming language scala. I also learned basic principals of data manipulation.
